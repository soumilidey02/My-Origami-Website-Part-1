<p><h1>History of Origami</h1></p>
<ul>

  <li><h3>Origami is derived from two Japanese words - Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Traditional origami uses a piece of paper in the shape of a square and does not permit any cutting.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>The art form has even inspired the design of things like airbags and heart stents.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Paper folding challenges us at the cognitive level as we follow instructions, learning new skills and activities.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them.</h3></li>
